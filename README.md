# RGB-
Decompose images in RGB layers, and generate RGB signals.

This program aims to decompose a digital image into three layers RGB, Red, Green and Blue, using Matlab software.

After decomposing the image an RGB matrix is created, with the intensity of each pixel separated in the three colors.

Subsequently using the values of the intensity of each pixel, generate a signal of the image.
